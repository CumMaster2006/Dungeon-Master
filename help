This is a tutorial on the game.
To play you need to choose doors, for example:
  You have only 4 DOOR (You must choose from 1 to how many shows)
  You need to choose from 1 to 4, in our example there are 4 of them, but there can be 3, 2 or 1)
When you meet an enemy you need to press enter to fight (During dialogs too)
